      <p> this a website dedicated to slam as pictured above. i (lily) made this as a side project but also as a way to always remember everything related to slam bc its a lot. incase we don't get to see each other during our post secondary studies, we can always refer back to this and go down memory lane. this could also turn into another thing we never use but i (lily) don't really care. </p>
